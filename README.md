\# Linux SOC Adventure: Securing a Linux Kingdom



\## Overview

This project is a hands-on simulation of Linux system hardening and Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring. I created a secure Linux environment, monitored processes, defended against simulated intruders, and maintained the integrity of sensitive files.



The project demonstrates practical Linux commands, process management, network defense, and file security.

\## Key Achievements

\- Secured sensitive files using `chmod` and hidden directories (`.vault`)

\- Monitored system processes with `top` and `htop`

\- Detected rogue SSH login attempts using `auth.log` and blocked intruders with `ufw`

\- Automated vault access using a custom bash alias (`showvault`)

\- Checked system health: CPU, memory, and disk usage

\- Practiced real-time SOC operations in a simulated Linux environment
